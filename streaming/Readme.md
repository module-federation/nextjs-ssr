# About

Library is a set of webpack plugins which gives support of Module Federation into NodeJS.

Usage example with NextJS https://github.com/telenko/node-mf-example

Here is also my [article](https://mangolik931.medium.com/how-i-implemented-module-federation-in-nodejs-and-did-something-wrong-724642c26da5) about this library.

# Purpose of creating

Release of [Webpack Module Federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) really have made a shift in modern architecture of web applications. But what about NodeJS and such frameworks like [Next](https://nextjs.org/)? What about SSR? I see for now a gap in webpack, so pure ModuleFederation plugin can not be used inside NodeJS environment. Muliple examples of NextJS+MF here https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples with NextJS using only client-side rendering or not using remote deployed build at all.

# What can I propose

I have implemented 2 plugins for webpack:

1. **NodeSoftwareStreamRuntime** - Plugin which should be used on a remote side to build remote scripts for NodeJS. But the main key of plugin is resolution of modules - it is done via http requests, so NodeJS can dynamically resolve child modules, load them and perform.
2. **StreamingFederation** - Plugin is wrapper around origin WebpackModuleFederation plugin and adds NodeJS specific resolution of remote modules (same thing: resolution is done via http requests)

# Getting started

### 1) On remote library:

1.1) Install package (remote can be either pure JS application or NodeJS application - doesn't matter)
`npm i --save-dev @telenko/node-mf`

1.2. Customize webpack configuration, so it should now build 2 targets: for web (if you want legacy browser build) and for node (webpack for now doesn't support universal targets)

1.3) For node build add **NodeSoftwareStreamRuntime** plugin and set webpack's 'target' flag to false

```js
//pseudocode
module.exports = [
  {
    target: "web",
    ...webOptionsWebpack,
  },
  {
    target: false,
    plugins: [
      new NodeSoftwareStreamRuntime(), //this is instead of target to make it work
    ],
    ...nodeOptionsWebpack,
  },
];
```

1.4) Serve both builds

Full example is here https://github.com/telenko/node-mf-example/blob/master/remoteLib/webpack.config.js

### 2) On NodeJS application:

2.1) Install library
`npm i --save-dev @telenko/node-mf`

2.2) Add **StreamingFederation** plugin to the webpack config (api parameters schema is same)
**!Note, remote script url should point to 'node' build (which should be built with NodeSoftwareStreamRuntime)**

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new StreamingFederation({
      remotes: {
        someLib: "someLib@http://some-url/remoteEntry.node.js",
      },
      shared: {
        lodash: {
          eager: true,
          singleton: true,
          requiredVersion: "1.1.2",
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
  ...otherWebpackOptions,
};
```

# Risks

## Aren't 2 build makes build-time 2 times longer?

Yes, if we speak about NextJS and SSR - we need both builds: for web and for node, and we have to start entire build separately without sharing built chunks. That will increase build time 2 times.

## Security

Since NodeJS out of the box doesn't support remote scripts execution (like in browser we can add **script** tag) it looks like a hack calling http request then 'eval'-ing it. I'm not sure if it is safe to add remote script execution on server side, but it is the only one possible way to make it on server.

# Roadmap

1. https support
2. Next.js support for NodeSoftwareStreamRuntime plugin
